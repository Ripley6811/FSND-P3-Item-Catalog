Fullstack project built using Flask with a PostgreSQL database on a virtual machine.

This is a website that saves restaurant menu information along with a review system
for helping people remember what was good or bad at various restaurants. It also
features a randomized recommendation system using a person's favorite in case they
need help deciding where to go eat.

Built with:

- **Flask** microframework connected to a **PostgreSQL** database
- **KnockoutJS** MVVM for a dynamic front-end
- **OAuth2** Google+ third-party login
- **Grunt-Readme** to generate the README from templates
- **Sphinx** for creating the project and API documentation website
