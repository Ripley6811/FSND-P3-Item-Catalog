Welcome to Jay's FSND-P3-Item-Catalog documentation!
====================================================
   
Summary
-------
Fullstack project built using Flask with a PostgreSQL database on a virtual machine.

This is a website that saves restaurant menu information along with a review system
for helping people remember what was good or bad at various restaurants. It also
features a randomized recommendation system using a person's favorite in case they
need help deciding where to go eat.

It was built using the Flask microframework connected to a PostgreSQL database, 
the KnockoutJS MVVM for a dynamic front-end, and Google+ third-party login
system (OAuth2).
